Section 1: Approach & Considerations

Managing State & Components:
I wanted to highlight that I am able to seperate components and create a coherent folder structure whilst building a project from scratch. I have become really comfortable passig state through components in a function based or even a classed based component as some legacy code bases still have classes.

Use of Methods:
In this project there wasn't much scope to showcase different use of methods. Nonetheless, the
.map() and the .filter() methods are very common and one has to become comfortable with them.

Use of tailwind css:
I wanted to showcase that I have become very comfortable with tailwind css. Notably, many developes and therefore companies are beginning to adopt tailwind css into their projects as you can build quite slick designs with it. I thought it would be fun to highlight that I can build nice looking projects quickly and the fact that I like to remain current in regards to new technologies.

Section 2: Trade Offs

Filter List:
Due to time constraints I decided not to create a filter for all the different listed objectives. I would have done this via a switch or some if else statements.
